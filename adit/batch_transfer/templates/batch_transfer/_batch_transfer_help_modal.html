<p>
    With this form you can create a new batch transfer job to transfer studies
    from a source server to a destination. Batch transfer jobs are put into a
    queue and will be processed by a worker when the time is right.
    You will get an Email when the job is finished (or failed for some reason).
</p>
<p>
    Each batch transfer job contains several transfer tasks that define what 
    studies to transfer. This data must be specified in a CSV file.
    If your data is in an Excel file then it can be exported to a CSV file.  
    The first row of the CSV file must contain the header with the column
    titles. The following rows contain the data that identfies the studies
    to transfer.
</p>
<p>
    The required PatientID and StudyInstanceUID can be fetched by doing a
    a "Batch Query". The resulting CSV file of a batch query can be used
    with minimal modifications for a batch transfer. You just have to make
    sure that the BatchID is unique (which may not be the case when batch
    query returns multiple studies for one query task).
</p>
<p>
    The following columns must be defined in the CSV file:
    <dl>
        <dt>BatchID</dt>
        <dd>A consecutive unique number that identifies the transfer (required).</dd>
        <dt>PatientID</dt>
        <dd>The unique ID of the patient in the PACS.</dd>
        <dt>StudyInstanceUID</dt>
        <dd>A unique ID that identifies the study.</dd>
        <dt>Pseudonym</dt>
        <dd>A pseudonym to pseudonymize the images during transfer.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>
<p>
    The provided pseudonym will be set as PatientID and PatientName. So it is
    best to use cryptic identifier strings like "XFE3TEW2N".

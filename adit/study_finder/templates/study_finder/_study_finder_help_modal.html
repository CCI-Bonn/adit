<p>
    With this form you can create a new batch transfer job to transfer studies
    from a source to a destination. Batch transfer jobs are put into a queue
    and will be processed by a worker when the time is right.
    The status of a job can be viewed on the "All Jobs" page and you will
    get an Email when the job is finished (or failed for some reason).
</p>

<p>
    Each batch transfer job contains several transfer requests that define what 
    to transfer. These requests must be provided in a CSV file. If your data
    is in an Excel file then it can be exported as a CSV file.  
    The first row of the CSV file must contain the header with the column
    titles. The following rows contain the requests.
</p>

<p>
    The following columns must be present in the CSV file:
    <dl>
        <dt>Row Number</dt>
        <dd>A consecutive unique number that identifies the row.</dd>
        <dt>Patient ID</dt>
        <dd>The unique ID of the patient in the PACS.</dd>
        <dt>Patient Name</dt>
        <dd>The name of the patient (optional if Patient ID is provided).</dd>
        <dt>Birth Date</dt>
        <dd>The birth date of the patient (optional if Patient ID is provided)</dd>
        <dt>Accession Number</dt>
        <dd>The unique ID of the study in the PACS</dd>
        <dt>Study Date</dt>
        <dd>The date when the study took place (optional if Accession Number is provided)</dd>
        <dt>Modality</dt>
        <dd>The modality of the study (optional if Accession Number is provided)</dd>
        <dt>Pseudonym</dt>
        <dd>An optional pseudonym to pseudonymize the images to transfer.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<div class="mb-1">A valid CSV file may look like this:</div>
<pre>
RowNumber;PatientID;PatientName;PatientBirthDate;AccessionNumber;StudyDate;Modality;Pseudonym
1;10007;Papaya, Pamela;29.08.1976;;19.08.2018;MR;ABU5QZL9
2;10002;Banana, Ben;18.02.1962;0062094291;;;DEDH6SVQ
3;10002;;18.02.1962;;15.09.2019;MR;DEDH6SVQ
</pre>

<p>
    The provided pseudonym will be set as Patient ID and Patient Name. So it is
    best to use something cryptic like in the above example (and not another
    person name).
